              The solution to this puzzle is remeniscent of a multi-way merge
              sort. To start, 5 ordered lists of horses are attained by
              conducting 5 races in which every horse is raced exactly once. A
              6th race is conducted with the winners of the previous 5 races.
              The winner of this race is guaranteed to be the overall fastest
              horse. A 7th race is conducted, replacing the winner of the 6th
              race with the horse that came directly behind it in one of the
              first 5 races. The winner of this race is guaranteed to be the
              second overall fastest horse. An 8th race is constructed in the
              same fashion - the winner of the 7th race is replaced with the
              horse that came directly behind it in one of the first 5 races.
              The winner of this race is guaranteed to be the third overall
              fastest horse. Thus, we have found the fastest 3 horses in only 8
              races!
              <br /> <br />
              But wait, we can optimize this solution and do slightly better!
              First, let's define group 1 as the 5 horses the winner of race 6
              was initially grouped with, group 2 as the 5 horses the runner-up
              of race 6 was initially grouped with, and so on. Notice that ALL
              horses from groups 4 and 5 already have at least 3 horses that are
              faster than them. Therefore, we should exclude them from any
              future races, as these horses cannot be the 2nd or 3rd overall
              fastest. In fact, after the 6th race, there are only a couple
              horses that have the potential to be the 2nd or 3rd fastest:
              <List
                sx={{
                  display: "flex",

                  <br />
                  The 2nd and 3rd fastest horses must be the 2nd and 3rd place

                  The 2nd and 3rd fastest horses must be the first place

                    same initial group:
                  </b>{" "}
                  <br />
                  The 2nd and 3rd fastest horses must be the winners of groups 2
                  and 3.
                </ListItem>
              </List>
              Notice that there are only 5 distinct horses vying for the
              remaining two spots in the trifecta - the 2nd and 3rd place
              finishers from group 1, the 1st and 2nd place finishers from group
              2, and the 1st place finisher from group 3. Thus, for our 7th
              race, we can simply race these 5 horses and declare the fastest
              two our overall second and third fastest horses! We've now found
              the fastest 3 horses in just 7 races, the optimal solution!

            <Typography align="left">
              The crux of implementing this puzzle is to, given a series of
              races, determine if the submitted horses <b>must</b> be the
              fastest 3. We can verify the above by constructing a simple graph.
              We start by creating 25 nodes, one for each horse. For each horse
              in each race, we draw an edge to the horse it finished directly in
              front of. Now, if there is exactly one source (a node with no
              incoming edges) in the resulting graph, then the horse
              corresponding to that node must be the fastest horse included in
              the graph.
