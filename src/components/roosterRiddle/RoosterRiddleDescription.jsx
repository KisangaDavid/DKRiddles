        You open the first envelope. Inside you find a notecard, along with two rat traps. The notecard reads: <br />
        <i>You will find that the neighborhood adjacent to yours is suffering from a mysterious rat infestation. 
        Solve their rodent problem using only the two provided rat traps and your own logical ability.</i> 
      </p>
      <p>After arriving at the rat infested neighborhood 
        and doing some preliminary investigation, you discover that the neighborhood is actually being plagued by just a single rat, 
        which sneaks over to an adjacent house every night. You know that if you trap houses 1 and 2 on the first day, 2 and 3 on the second day,
        3 and 4 on the third day, and so on, you can guarantee that you'll catch the rat in 7 days. However, Mr. Riddle Man will not accept anything but perfection - 
        what strategy can you employ that is guaranteed to catch the rat in the least amount of days?
